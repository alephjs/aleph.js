4. Change code then run the examples.
5. Push your branch to Github after all tests passed.
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/alephjs/aleph.js/pulls).
7. Merge to master branch by our maintainers.

```bash
# ssr/development with HMR
ALEPH_DEV=true deno run -A --unstable --import-map=./import_map.json cli.ts dev ./examples/hello-world -L debug

# ssr/production
ALEPH_DEV=true deno run -A --unstable --import-map=./import_map.json cli.ts start ./examples/hello-world -L debug

## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples:

```
docs(changelog): update change log to 0.0.9
```
